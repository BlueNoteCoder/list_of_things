# List of Things

## About List of Things

This project started when I was tired of using a text editor to keep track of books I've read/wanted to read.
Now all you have to do is input your book information rather than having to worry about everything else!

## Features

List of Things has just hit the ground running. So be expected to find more features being added often!

At this time the following is provided for the user:

	1. Easy to navigate command-line app
	2. Basic CRUD operations
	3. A way to display all books you've read in a neat fashion
